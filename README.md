- Eye/Jaw Movement Detection

**DISCLAIMER (I have yet to upload the code I edited)
**This is adapted from Alexandre Barachant's Muselsl code. Full credits to https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl

I used this code to detect my eye movement with the Muse S headset. By using an electroencephalogram (EEG), I was able to have my code recognize my neuroelectrical activity. Please note that errors do EXIST in the repo, this is just the main code I used.
