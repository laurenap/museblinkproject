# BCI Project #2 Eye/Jaw Movement Detection

I used this code to detect my eye movement with the Muse S headset. By using an electroencephalogram (EEG), I was able to have my code recognize my neuroelectrical activity. Please note that errors do EXIST in the repo, this is just the main code I used.
